Scenario: Execute command: `show ssh server host-keys`
When I execute interactive command "show ssh server host-keys" with prompt "#"
Then commands should complete successfully
And I put the output into "OUTPUT"

Scenario: Validate the `SSH server configuration` and `Host Key Finger Prints and Key Lengths` sections
Given "REGEX" value is "[.\s\S]*(Host Key Finger Prints and Key Lengths:)(((\s+[A-Z]+ v.+ host key:\s+\(key missing or invalid\))|(\s+[A-Z]+ v.+ host key:\s+SHA.+))+)(\s+exinda.*)[.\s\S]*"
Given "HOST_KEYS_SECTION" value is "{regex_replace(OUTPUT,REGEX,'MATCH_FOUND')}"
Then the value of "OUTPUT" should contain "SSH server configuration:"
And the value of "OUTPUT" should contain "Host Key Finger Prints and Key Lengths:"
And the value of "HOST_KEYS_SECTION" should be equal to "MATCH_FOUND"
