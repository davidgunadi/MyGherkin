Scenario: Go to Monitor -> Real Time
When I click on "Monitor"
And I click on "Monitor Realtime"
And I click on "Hosts/Users tab"
And I "check" "Show Users checkbox" checkbox
And I wait until "Inbound Hosts/Users rows containing name" appears
Then I put total count of "Inbound Hosts/Users rows containing name" into "RowCount"
And the value of "RowCount" should be greater than 0

Scenario: Save a random Host/User row
Given "RandomPosition" default value is "{random_number(1,RowCount)}"
Given "HostUserFormat" default value is "(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\s\((.+)\)"
When I hover on "Inbound Hosts/Users rows containing name"
Then I put a value from "Inbound Hosts/Users row according to <RandomPosition>" into "HostUser"
And the value of "HostUser" should not be empty

Scenario: Verify if the random Host/User exists in the Exinda Users file
Given "Name address Host" default value is "{regex_replace(HostUser,HostUserFormat,'$2 address $1')}"
When I hover on "Inbound Hosts/Users rows containing name"
Then the value of "File Content" should contain "{Name address Host}"
