Feature: VERD-3743

As an administrator, I should see the creation and deletion times of a policy when I query the Surveyor database.
This is traceable because Administrators should be able to trace policy timestamps.

Scenario: Preconditions
Given quality bar version "20200115.1"
Given environment "QA" from "https://confluence.devfactory.com/display/AVOLIN/Non-prod+Environments"
Given credentials "DB user"

Scenario: Get Policy create time
Given DB connection to "Surveyor Database"
When I execute query "SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),GETDATE(),121) AS DATETIME"
Then queries should complete successfully
And I remember the result set as "RESULT"
And "SERVERDATE_ROW" is a jsonpath selected value "$[0]" from "RESULT"

Scenario: Create and delete a policy
When I execute scenario "VERD-3739" to capture outputs "POLICY_NAME"
Then scenario steps should complete successfully

Scenario: Get Policy create time
Given "SERVER_DATETIME" value is "{SERVERDATE_ROW.DATETIME}"
Given DB connection to "Surveyor Database"
When I execute query "SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),StartDateTimeUtc,121) AS START_DATETIME FROM [dbo].[PolicyHistory] WHERE PolicyPath LIKE '%{POLICY_NAME}%'"
Then queries should complete successfully
And I put the result set into "RESULT"
And "START_ROW" is a jsonpath selected value "$[0]" from "RESULT"
And the value of "START_ROW.START_DATETIME" should be greater than or equal to "{SERVER_DATETIME}"

Scenario: Get Policy delete time
When I execute query "SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),EndDateTimeUtc,121) AS END_DATETIME FROM [dbo].[PolicyHistory] WHERE PolicyPath LIKE '%{POLICY_NAME}%'"
Then queries should complete successfully
And I put the result set into "RESULT"
And "END_ROW" is a jsonpath selected value "$[0]" from "RESULT"
And the value of "END_ROW.END_DATETIME" should be greater than or equal to "{START_ROW.START_DATETIME}"
